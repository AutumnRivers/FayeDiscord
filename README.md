## Who/What is Faye?
Faye is a Discord bot made for [Autumn's Galaxy](https://discord.gg/2w9VTE7) that's designed as a personal assistant to the members and moderators! Faye is an all-in-one Discord bot that can do anything from creating role menus, to timing out users, to playing a game of Wordle in Discord! And the best part? Its creator doesn't support NFTs!

## Can I invite Faye to my server?
Unfortunately, no. Faye is built from the ground up to only be used with one specific server. However, the code is here, so you can edit the code to your liking and host your own instance of Faye!
